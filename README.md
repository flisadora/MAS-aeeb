## Academic Subject: Analysis and Modelling of Systems

Project Goal: it is intended that students create specifications for an information system, applying:
- A systems analysis method;
- Visual models to characterize different parts of the IS. At the end, the result should include:
  - A proposal for the digital transformation of an activity/business area;
  - The specification of new work processes/activities supported by the SI;
  - The specification of functional requirements with use-case models;
  - Specification of quality attributes;
  - Domain model (concept map);
  - Exploratory prototypes as a requirements validation strategy.
  - Exploratory implementation (presentation layer, on the web).
